A Flutter package that helps reduce your app size by analyzing, cleaning, and optimizing assets.

## Features

- üîç **Asset Analysis**: Find unused and large assets in your Flutter project
- üßπ **Asset Cleaning**: Remove unused assets to reduce app size
- üöÄ **Asset Optimization**: Optimize large assets to improve performance
- üìä **Detailed Reports**: Get comprehensive reports about your assets
- üîß **Configurable**: Customize the behavior through a configuration file
- üõ†Ô∏è **CLI Support**: Use through command-line interface or programmatically

## Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
  dependencies:
    flutter_app_size_reducer: ^<latest_version>
```
Then run:
flutter pub get


## Usage

### Command Line Interface

Initialize the configuration:

```bash
dart run flutter_app_size_reducer init
```

Analyze your assets:

```bash
dart run flutter_app_size_reducer analyse
```

### Programmatic Usage

```dart
import 'package:flutter_app_size_reducer/flutter_app_size_reducer.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize configuration
  await FlutterAppSizeReducer.init();
  
  // Analyze assets
  final results = await FlutterAppSizeReducer.analyze();
  print('Unused assets: ${results['unusedAssets']}');
  print('Large assets: ${results['largeAssets']}');
  
  // Clean unused assets
  await FlutterAppSizeReducer.clean(dryRun: true);
  
  // Optimize assets
  await FlutterAppSizeReducer.optimize(quality: 80);
}
```

## Configuration

Create a `flutter_app_size_reducer.yaml` file in your project root:

asset_directories:
  - assets/
  - images/

# File extensions to consider as assets
asset_extensions:
  - .png
  - .jpg
  - .jpeg
  - .gif
  - .webp

# Maximum size for assets (in bytes)
max_asset_size: 100000

# Quality for optimized images (0-100)

# Exclude patterns
exclude_patterns:
  - "**/*.min.*"
  - "**/generated/*"
